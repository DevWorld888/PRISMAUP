      <p>Choosing the right paint color can completely transform your home. In 2025, Sydney homeowners are leaning toward bold, sustainable, and sophisticated palettes. At <strong>Prisma Coatings Sydney</strong>, weâ€™ve identified the top trends shaping Australian interiors and exteriors this year.</p>

      <h2>Warm Earth Tones Inspired by Nature</h2>
      <p>From terracotta to ochre, earthy shades reflect our connection to the Australian landscape. These colors bring warmth to living rooms, coziness to bedrooms, and elegance to exteriors.</p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Outdoor Facades:</strong> Ochres and browns blend beautifully with gardens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bold Feature Walls</h2>
      <p>Sydney homeowners are increasingly embracing deep navy, emerald green, and burgundy accent walls. These statement walls elevate modern apartments and suburban homes alike, giving them personality and depth.</p>

      <h2>Eco-Friendly Paints</h2>
      <p>With health and sustainability in mind, low-VOC and natural paints are in high demand. They reduce harmful emissions and improve indoor air quality while offering beautiful matte and satin finishes.</p>

    focusKeywords: ["exterior house painting Sydney", "house painting preparation", "Sydney painters"],

    content: `
      <p>Exterior painting can protect your home, boost its value, and transform its appearance. But preparation is the most important step. At <strong>Prisma Coatings</strong>, we know that skipping prep leads to costly mistakes. Hereâ€™s our professional guide for Sydney homeowners.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Surface Cleaning</h2>
      <p>Pressure washing removes dirt, mold, and peeling paint. Allow 24â€“48 hours for surfaces to dry fully before continuing.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Inspect and Repair</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for cracks, gaps, or wood rot.</li>
        <li>Fill holes with exterior filler.</li>
        <li>Replace damaged weatherboards or trims.</li>
        <li>Caulk around windows and doors to seal gaps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Sanding and Priming</h2>
      <p>Sanding ensures smooth adhesion. The right primer (oil, water, or masonry-based) will help the paint bond and extend durability.</p>

      <h2>Step 4: Weather Considerations</h2>
      <p>Sydneyâ€™s climate is unique. Avoid painting on humid days, in direct harsh sunlight, or just before rain. Ideal conditions are mild temperatures with low humidity.</p>

      <h2>FAQs About Exterior Painting Prep</h2>
      <h3>Do I need a primer if the surface was painted before?</h3>
      <p>Yes, primers ensure even coverage and prevent old paint from showing through.</p>

      <h3>Can I DIY prep?</h3>
      <p>DIY prep is possible, but professional painters ensure thorough cleaning, repairs, and long-lasting results.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>A great paint job starts with preparation. <a href="/contact">Contact Prisma Coatings Sydney</a> today to get a professional team that guarantees a durable finish for your home.</p>

      <p>Selecting the right paint finish is about more than looksâ€”it affects durability, cleaning, and atmosphere. At <strong>Prisma Coatings</strong>, we guide Sydney homeowners in making the right choice for each space.</p>

      <h2>Matte Finish</h2>
      <p>Soft, non-reflective, and perfect for hiding imperfections. Best for adult bedrooms, ceilings, and cozy spaces.</p>

      <h2>Eggshell Finish</h2>
      <p>Low sheen but more durable than matte. Ideal for living rooms, dining areas, and hallways where occasional cleaning is needed.</p>

      <h2>Satin Finish</h2>
      <p>A versatile choice with a smooth look and good washability. Works well in kitchens, family rooms, and childrenâ€™s bedrooms.</p>

      <h2>Semi-Gloss and Gloss</h2>
      <p>Highly durable, easy to clean, and moisture resistant. Perfect for trims, doors, cabinets, and bathrooms.</p>

      <h2>FAQs About Paint Finishes</h2>
      <h3>Which finish is easiest to clean?</h3>
      <p>Gloss and satin are the most washable, making them ideal for high-traffic areas.</p>

      <h3>Does matte paint last long?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but itâ€™s better suited to low-traffic rooms since it can mark more easily.</p>
